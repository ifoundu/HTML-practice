    <p>My first day of the trip!I can't believe
        I finally got everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a segway,I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:cell
        phone,ipod,digital camera,and a protein bar.Just the essentials.As Lao Tzu would have said,<q>A journey of a thousand miles
            begins with one step segway. </q>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:"Passing cars,When
        you can't see, May get you,A glimpse,Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.
